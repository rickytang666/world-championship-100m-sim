 Date: October 10th, 2024
 Purpose: This program takes in the top 56 athletes as of October 15th 2024. It simulates a brilliant matchup
 between them by computing the weather, health, and other effects.
 You can either choose the commenting in console or animation in graphics. But no matter what you will have a full
 "Professional results booklet" in .txt exported

/*

 IMPORTANT DECLAIMER
 When you see 2 athletes have the "same" numeric value, their times are NOT different, they are simply rounded and displayed.
 For example, 9.999 and 9.999 can actually be 9.9981 and 9.9983, and etc.
